``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

### Loading the data from p8105.datasets

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 2

### Loading BRFSS data from p8105.datasets

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

### Data Cleaning

##### Format the data to use appropriate variable names

##### Cleaning names (to use appropriate variable names)

##### Focus on the “Overall Health” topic

##### Including only responses from Excellent to Poor

``` r
hw4_data=
  brfss_smart2010 |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  filter(topic=="Overall Health", response== "Excellent" | response == "Very good"| response =="Good" | response =="Fair" | response =="Poor") |>
  mutate(response=fct_relevel(response,c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
```

### Q1: In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

### Q2: Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

### Q3: Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.
